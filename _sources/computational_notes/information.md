# Purpose of the notes

The computational notes (notebooks) in this section, are at the moment about rather basic (yet powerful) statistics/machine learning concepts, currently mostly for pedagogical purposes. They may contain novel ideas. Note that it is possible to launch the computational notebooks on Binder and on Google Colab, from the rocket icon on the page of the notebook.

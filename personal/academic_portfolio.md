Such calls for and requires bringing together fundamental (formal, natural, social), interdisciplinary and applied sciences, academic and industrial sector, national and international, and doing both theoretical and applied work.
The need for such is also evident by the witnessed force of artificial intelligence with machine learning in the core, driven by, e.g., the increasing availability and allocation of data and information, computing, natural and humanly resources. 
The need is increasing, e.g., to keep the development cycle as (humanly and naturally) virtuous as possible.

* **Pedagogical training:** A! Peda Intro (5 cr.), Spring 2016, Aalto University
* **Ability to produce teaching materials:** I have planned and produced the contents of many of the courses mentioned above. For several courses, the new courses, a lot of the contents were produced from scratch.
In the deep learning courses mentioned above, we had course assistants who helped in producing exercise materials; however, the lecture and examination materials were done strictly by the teachers. 
At Lapland University of Applied Sciences, there were no teaching assistants, and every learning material produced was by the teacher. The materials have typically been presentation slides, software codes, etc. 
I have utilized state-of-the-art technological solutions in producing materials, and have been centrally involved in modernizing local practices (see next).
* **Other teaching merits:** Initiated, managed and otherwise also contributed to, at Lapland University of Applied Sciences, a project that produces electronic, open learning materials on natural sciences and beyond, modernizing and harmonizing learning materials in the respective areas at the university of applied sciences -level.   
* **Teaching statement:** 'To unlock the human potential. To unlock the potential of statistics, data science, and intelligence engineering.' Statistics, data science, and (the emerging) intelligence engineering, the central research areas of focus, are increasingly needed and used for developing teaching, improving human learning. An example is in obtaining personalization at scale. 
  The needed learning analytics methods, and human and machine co-learning etc., will play an increasingly large role in the future, and am keen to utilize and also take part in developing the methodologies as well. I have done <a href="https://digivisio2030.fi/en/publications/preliminary-study-ai-supported-guidance/">some work</a> for the area of utilizing AI in teaching/learning, already, under contract work for the Digivision 2030 programme (see below).
  I'm comfortable teaching from undergraduate to post-graduate level and beyond (but preference to the latter ones), with theoretical and/or practical focus. 

## 5. Other qualifications and merits
* **Socially significant elected positions or expert assignments based on academic or pedagogical merit:**
  * Program committee member for International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (ICANN), 2014.  
  * Reviewed for conferences: International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (ICANN), European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV); have had to decline several review invitations (NeurIPS, NIPS, AISTATS; also leading conferences in their respective areas) due to lack of time. 
  * Reviewed for journals: IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, and IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing.
  * Selected to co-organize (with another person), and co-organized a workshop series on artificial intelligence for (human) learning (focus on study guidance and counselling services), under contract with Digivisio 2030 programme; the goal of the programme ”is to create an internationally esteemed learning ecosystem that widely benefits society as a whole” https://digivisio2030.fi/en/future-of-learning/, and it involves all of the 38 Finnish higher education institutions. The work will be used in the development of the ecosystem.
* **Significant elected positions based on academic and pedagogical qualifications, membership in working groups and committees, and other university‐level administrative duties:**

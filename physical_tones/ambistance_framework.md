# Progress by terminology, framework for ambistance

I have written a facebook post that, e.g., investigates effect of "sport" terminology - focusing on skateboarding but providing generality - to the progress of it (and beyond). The post also provides potential framework for what is termed ambistance, such as maneuver/trick terminology, 
performance assessment for competing and practise, including utilizing AI in them. These could give further life and progress to the ambistance, and also to the particular sport (also a form of art, expression, and many other things), and beyond.
